# Unknown Twitter Language Data

##### This is similar to our experimental folder. However this is a complete set of all data tagged as unknown language in the research we are referencing.
##### This readme or our report will be updated with a citation. For now I am linking the url. We will be manually parsing this data for bilingual tweets
##### in order to form a corpora. Note that in better circumstances we would have annotates proficient in several languages confirm languages and skip 
##### in those cases when the language is not known to them. Instead we are doing a cursory manual analysis and parse on our own.

#### Contains a little over 5500 tweets. Data and references obtained from:

#### A useful tidbit of information

##### The following url with id substituted for "id" will open tweets given the id's in our tab delimited file. 
##### This is useful for manually checking if tweets are bilingual or not. Url below:

twitter.com/anyuser/status/ "id"
