# For picking out bilingual tweets from preprocessed data from our two twitter tags of unk and es

#### I have moved the out.csv files and renamed them. These are the processed files from the spanish and unk twitter data folders.
#### This program iterates over both csv tables and asks for your input on if a tweet is bilingual or not.
#### Afterwards, it writes what you found to a file named biList.csv. Rename this file if you want to run it again without overwriting results.
#### For further instructions on how to use the program, just run it and it will have instructions in the commandline.

#### To run the program, run the following command:
python python pickBilingualTweets.py
